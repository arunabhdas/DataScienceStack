}


// Set pagination options
paginate Scientist with infinite-scroll
paginate Area with pagination

// Use Data Transfer Objects (DTO)
// dto * with mapstruct

// Set service options to all except few
service all with serviceImpl except Scientist, Area

// Set an angular suffix
// angularSuffix * with mySuffix
```

## Debug develop

* Debug develop using
